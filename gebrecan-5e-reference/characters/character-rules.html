            <h4>Combat Superiority</h4>
            <p>
              When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority
              dice.
            </p>
            <p>Maneuver descriptions begin on page ###.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Maneuvers.</strong> You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way.
              You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th
              level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Superiority Dice.</strong> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when
              you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or Long Rest. You gain another
              superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Saving Throws.</strong> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the
              maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
            </p>
            <p>Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Student of War</h4>
            <p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat,
              you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is
              your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strength score</li>
              <li>Dexterity score</li>
              <li>Constitution score</li>
              <li>Armor Class</li>
              <li>Current hit points</li>
              <li>Total class levels, if any</li>
              <li>Fighter class levels, if any</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Improved Combat Superiority</h4>
            <p>At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Relentless</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority
              die.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>
            <p>
              When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:
              Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Born to the Saddle</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid
              falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if
              you’re not incapacitated.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Unwavering Mark</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When
              you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This
              effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.
            </p>
            <p>
              While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make an addition attack as
              part of an attack action against the marked creature. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the
              attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your
              Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Warding Maneuver</h4>
            <p>
              At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a
              creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a
              melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the
              attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain
              all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Hold the Line</h4>
            <p>
              At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you
              when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the
              target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Ferocious Charger</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a
              straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a
              Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this
              feature only once on each of your turns.

            <h4>Vigilant Defender</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction
              that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an
              opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

            <h4>Improved Critical</h4>
            <p>
              Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or
              20.

            <h4>Remarkable Athlete</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or
              Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to
              your Strength modifier.

          <div>
            <h4>Superior Critical</h4>
            <p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p>

            <h4>Survivor</h4>
            <p>
              At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit
              points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain
              this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>
              You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your
              choice at 10th level.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p>
              The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level
              and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you
              can cast Shield using either slot.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>
              You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and
              evocation spells on the wizard spell list.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st
              level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new
              spell of 1st or 2nd level.
            </p>
            <p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
            <p>
              Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of
              your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must
              be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level
              from any school of magic.

          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>
              Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and
              memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
              your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack
              roll with one.
            </p>
            <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>
            <p>
              When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice:
              History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Fighting Spirit</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. If you do not move on your
              turn, you can give yourself advantage on all weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When you do so,
              you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this
              class, increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.
            </p>
            <p>You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Elegant Courtier</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you
              make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency,
              you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Tireless Spirit</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Rapid Strike</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn
              and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make
              an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per
              turn.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Strength Before Death</h4>
            <p>
              Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0
              hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn.
              While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and
              three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still
              have 0 hit points.
            </p>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
