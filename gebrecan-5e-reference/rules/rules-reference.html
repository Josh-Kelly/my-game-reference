      <h4>Bleeding Out</h4>
      <p>When violent means reduce your hit points to 0, you are Bleeding Out. While Bleeding out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the start of each of your turns, the DM rolls a Death Save (d20 with no modifiers) and does not reveal the result. On a
          10 or higher, you succeed, on a 9 or lower you fail. At three successes, you stabilize at 0 hit points. At three failures,
          you die. A natural 1 is two failed saves. A natural 20 returns you to 1 hit point and ends the Bleeding Out condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Failed Death Saves remain until you complete a Long Rest. Successful Death Saves are lost as soon as you cease Bleeding
          Out.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can EITHER Move up to half your movement speed OR use an Object Interaction. Either options causes your next Death
          Save to have disadvantage. If you are stabilized, either of these options cause you to return to making Death Saves.
        </li>
        <li>
          You all ability checks, saving throws (other than Death Saves), and attack rolls at disadvantage.
        </li>
